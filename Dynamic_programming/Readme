This folder contains the notes for dynamic programming course on YouTube (https://youtu.be/oBt53YbR9Kk). 

Note that I'm just a rookie who just started learning, so the algorithms I uploaded probably is not the optimal one (and sometimes may even contain mistakes).
So for those who are more experienced in this, if you happen to have some suggestions, please feel free to leave them at the comment session. Thanks.
